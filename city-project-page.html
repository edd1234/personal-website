                <p id="summary-text">American cities are changing rapidly from trends seen in the rise of the Sun Belt to the decline of the industrial Midwest. For me personally, cities have always been a fascinating subject and I wanted to study
                    them using statistical and data analysis techniques to explain some of these trends.
                </p>
                <p id="summary-text-title"><b style="color: rgb(140, 19, 246)">Summary and Results:</b></p>
                <p id="summary-text">For this project, I worked with datasets from the US Census Bureau, the FBI Crime Database, 
                    Bureau of Labor Statistics to model urban demographic trends. Specifically, I looked at data on the 800 largest
                    cities in the US.
                </p>
                <p> Here are the types of data that I looked at:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Financial (Income, Home Price, Poverty Levels, Education Level)</li>
                    <li>Crime (Violent Crime Rate)</li>
                    <li>Demographic (Population Growth, Race)</li>
                    <li>Geographical</li>
                    <li>Climate</li>
                    <li>Transportation</li>
                </ul>
                <p> These are the steps in which I took when working on this project:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Data Cleaning</li>
                    <li>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</li>
                    <li>Creating ML Models</li>
                </ul>
                

                <p>Overall, the best ML models were able to accurately predict 70% of the test dataset into three categories of cities
                    (low-growth: &lt5%, medium growth: 5%-10%, high-growth: &gt10%). 
                </p>
                <p>Some of the features were not included into the model due to multicollinearity concerns. As such, the total amount of usable features 
                    were fewer than initally looked at. Furthermore, the model was able to predict the model accurately but it could not predict the specific growth
                    rate as well. The model was able to predict whether a city was a high-growth city or not but not by how much a certain city would increase (or decrease)
